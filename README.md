# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Paste a sample of your app's CLI or Streamlit output here so a reader can see what a generated plan looks like:

Today's Schedule
----------------
08:00 - Morning feeding (daily)
09:00 - Litter box cleanup (daily)
18:30 - Evening walk (daily)

```
# e.g.:
# Daily plan for Biscuit (Golden Retriever):
#   08:00 — Morning walk (30 min) [priority: high]
#   09:00 — Feeding (10 min) [priority: high]
#   ...
```

## 🧪 Testing PawPal+

Run the test suite with:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The tests cover the core scheduler behaviors: chronological sorting, recurring task completion, duplicate-time conflict detection, filtering, and date-based task scheduling.

Successful test run output:

## 📐 Smarter Scheduling

| Feature | Method(s) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Task sorting | `Scheduler.sort_by_time()` | Sorts tasks by parsed time first, then keeps a stable order with frequency and description tie-breakers. |
| Filtering | `Scheduler.filter_tasks()` | Filters tasks by pet name and/or completion status before building a display list. |
| Conflict handling | `Scheduler.get_conflict_warnings()` | Detects same-time overlaps and returns warning strings instead of crashing. |
| Recurring tasks | `Task.occurs_on()`, `Task.next_occurrence_date()`, `Task.create_next_occurrence()` | Handles daily, weekly, monthly, and every-n-days recurrence rules when deciding what appears on a date. |
